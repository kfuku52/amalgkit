Residual DNA was digested using DNase I (Takara). Library construction and sequencing for the Illumina HiSeq 2500 was provided as a custom service of Eurofins Genomics K. K. (Tokyo, Japan). The polyA fraction (mRNA) was isolated from total RNA, followed by its fragmentation. Then double-stranded (ds) cDNA was reverse transcribed from fragmented mRNA. The ds cDNA fragments were processed for adaptor ligation, size selection (for 200 bp inserts) and amplification to generate strand-specific cDNA libraries.
